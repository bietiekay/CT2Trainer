# Reference-table 100% roadmap

Status: 2026-10-20. Active plan after the 0.16 Wave 4 release. The older
AP/WP plans record completed implementation history; this document defines
the next work. [TRACKING.md](TRACKING.md) is the status ledger.

## Outcome and measurement

The target is **all 151 local-only reference-table paths, including all 143
distinct byte hashes, supported for their intended behavior** by an
independently implemented, redistributable CT2Trainer. The snapshot is fixed
by a manifest of path, SHA-256, format, and exact target EXE name. Replacing
or adding a table creates a new baseline; it does not silently change the
denominator. Preserve original tables outside Git and release archives.
The requested parity scope is trainer/cheat handling and game-facing
effects. CE's editor and visual UI do not need replication. A UI API used
by a table to cause a game-facing effect must still have an equivalent
behavioral path; a purely decorative UI call can be classified no-effect.
The initial [capability assessment](../documentation/ce-feature-parity-assessment.md)
defines this scope and the evidence method.

"Supported" has three separate proofs:

1. **Load and inspect:** every table is read. Every source record and
   game-facing table-level construct is accounted for; UI-only constructs
   are classified separately.
2. **Plan and execute:** every intended actionable record can be built and
   exercised with the right dependency, activation, disable, value, resource,
   and UI behavior. A `staged` record counts only after its runtime gate is
   exercised. A named blocked record is honest but does not count as
   supported. Inert headings and malformed/no-effect rows are classified
   separately with evidence, never used to inflate the action numerator.
3. **Observed effect:** for each original table, representative actions and
   every distinct behavior contract are verified against the intended game
   build or an explicitly equivalent owned target. Static compilation and
   synthetic fixtures alone do not prove the original game effect. Windows
   and Steam Deck acceptance remain separate.

The existing 42/42 feature matrix covers the **30 synthetic pinned cases**;
it is not a 100% result for the original reference corpus. The current
original-table catalog is **114,926 supported (58,950 staged) and 2,698
blocked out of 117,624 plan entries**, with one whole-table legacy-binary
read error, from the 2026-10-20 post-Wave-4 run. The AP-11 synthetic
campaign has **0/6,143 confirmed game effects**. These are separate metrics.
The 151 paths include duplicate bytes; report both path and distinct-hash
coverage. Re-run the catalog on the exact 0.16 source with a fixed process
manifest before changing code, since the catalog is local-only evidence.

Progress reports must state the numerator/denominator for table load,
actionable records, staged runtime validations, observed game contracts,
Windows, and Deck. Do not call the overall goal complete until each is full
and every exception has a documented, user-approved scope decision. A
legacy binary table, missing source asset, or deliberately unsupported CE
host API is a remaining gap under this goal, even if its refusal is safe.

## Clean-room boundary

The CE 7.5 local source tree may be read solely to identify behavior and
public format/API contracts under the user decision in `AGENTS.md`. No CE
code, binary, table content, or derived implementation enters CT2Trainer.
Write original designs and synthetic minimal cases; record the behavioral
observation and independent implementation separately. The converter and
local analysis never execute original-table Lua or AA. Runtime execution
is confined to a generated trainer attached to its intended target. Keep
the original reference corpus and raw catalogs local-only.

## Ordered work

| ID | Deliverable | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RT-1 | Reproducible full-corpus baseline | Versioned local manifest for 151 paths/143 hashes; exact process bindings; same-source catalog; per-table and per-reason counts; record IDs and provider chains; 0.16 comparison with no unaccounted regression. Separate parse errors, inert records, staged rows, actionable rows, and table-level constructs. |
| RT-2 | Root-cause map for every residual | Resolve all 2,698 blocked entries to an upstream cause or verified malformed authoring input. Follow provider cascades to their root; distinguish real missing semantics from false positives and duplicate provider policy. Record a testable contract, risk, and expected delta for each class. |
| RT-3 | Load all table formats | Investigate the remaining legacy binary CT format with a clean-room parser or documented conversion path; preserve record identity and data. Table load reaches 151/151, subject to explicit evidence for genuinely unreadable inputs. |
| RT-4 | Close high-volume plan gaps | Start with the 331 Octopath2 relative-address rows, the `Esau_base` provider cascade (600 reason occurrences), other provider cascades, 53 pointer-offset refusals, duplicate-provider cases, and AA expression/cleanup failures. A reason count is not an independent feature count; remeasure after each fix. |
| RT-5 | Runtime trainer parity | Inventory every used CE Lua/AA API and game-facing table-level construct, including dynamic records, callbacks, target threads, managed resolution, string hex view, and byte-width dropdown semantics. Implement each needed behavior with bounded contracts, teardown rules, and owned-target tests; classify purely visual UI as outside scope. |
| RT-6 | Full original-table validation | For each path, produce a plan-inspection result and targeted runtime observations against a pinned game build where available. Record skipped or inaccessible targets honestly. Run the Windows clean-machine and Deck/Proton/touch protocols; keep `runtime_unverified` until both pass. |
| RT-7 | Release gate | Rebuild only through `scripts/Build-Native.ps1`; full suite and source/frozen parity; `ce_inputs: []`; archive hashes and provenance; update tracker, ledger, and verification before declaring 100%. |

RT-1 and RT-2 are the first implementation cycle. RT-3 and RT-4 follow
root-cause evidence; RT-5 can proceed in isolated files after contracts
are specified. RT-6 runs continuously as target access permits. There is
no percentage shortcut based on the old feature matrix or an estimated
closure rate.

## Immediate investigation queue

The 2026-10-20 catalog's leading reasons are `Esau_base` provider (600),
addressless-script/value-ancestor relative addresses (331), `mouse_ovr`
provider (84), `BaseAddress` provider (80), `loot_ptr` provider (62), and
pointer offsets (53). These are *reason occurrences*, not necessarily
independent blocked actions; a first-matching reason and provider cascade
can hide another failure. Highest blocked tables include Octopath Traveler
2 (333), DS2 (205), and Atomic Heart v1.2 (166). Before assigning a code
package, inspect the actual local table shape, reproduce it with an
independently authored synthetic case, and specify the expected runtime
behavior and regression checks. The Wave-4 snapshot had one known load
error, `SuperMeatBoy.CT` (legacy binary format).

## Integration protocol

Use a new milestone working branch. Each integrated package includes a
focused synthetic case, runtime tests where effects matter, full suite,
catalog delta with zero unexplained supported regressions, updated
[`STATUS.md`](../STATUS.md), central tracker and ledger in the same change,
then normal merge and push to `main` under `AGENTS.md`.
Root owns the catalog and documentation. Subagent lanes follow
`documentation/subagent-lane-rules.md`; when the user directs a different
launch policy for a session, follow that instruction. Never infer game
effect from a green static catalog.
